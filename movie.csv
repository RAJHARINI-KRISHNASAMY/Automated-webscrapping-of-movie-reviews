Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),I enjoyed this movie,"This third installment is just as long, fixes some of the damages but adds along new ones. At Worlds End improves on its CGI magic but still possesses that dragging story that is just too long and confusing.

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),"Best out of the ""pirates"" trilogy...I'm not disappointed!","I'm a huge fan of the Piates of the Caribbean movies, but I was a little nervous about seeing this third installment because of the not as good other third installments. I still had pretty high expectations, and I was not disappointed! The plot was brilliant and very creative, with plenty of exciting twists and turns. As always, the acting was incredible. Johnny Depp always does an amazing job, but his Captain Jack Sparrow is probably one of his bests works yet! I still don't see how anyone could be so brilliant... Anyways, overall, just a really great film. Better than the other Pirate films in the trilogy (and you know how good those are!) See it, you won't be disappointed!

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),"Good conclusion to the series, same problems as the 2nd","AWE was a decent close to the trilogy (although they did leave it open for the possibility of a 4th).

Lets go down the list: 1) Holy cow. The CGI is breathtaking. The details on the sets is just as breathtaking. The filming sites were beautiful. These are a talented group of folks I tell ya. GREAT job.

2) Acting .. both good and bad. Sparrow, Barbossa, Beckett, Norrington, Jones, and Gibbs provided some very good acting and funny moments. However, they were offset by Pintel and Ragetti (they got annoying in the 2nd film and it didn't stop here. While I enjoyed the idea of Tia Dalma's character, I wasn't impressed with the performance by beautiful Miss Harris. I haven't especially liked Keira all that much in other things she has done and it was the same here. Decent actress but not overly impressive. Stellan's portrayal of Bill Turner was decent enough but a notch down from what we KNOW he can do. Now the best for last. Im a 100% hetero male and even I can say that Orlando Bloom is a VERY good looking guy. But for the love of pete, this guy is one of the most terrible actors ever and strangely, he was cast in two of the biggest, most profitable trilogies ever. He has essentially played the same character in every movie, just with different costumes. His mannerisms, his low ""sexy"" voice, his facial expressions .. ALLLL the same, all the time. Sooo blahhhhhhh.

3) The story was good but there was too much of it. It has been said here but I will say it again. At one point, I just stopped trying to follow along and just enjoyed it. Everyone stabbed everyone else in the back at least once. It wasn't ""hard to follow"" but a movie like this isn't supposed to make you think. You want that, go see .... Clue :P the whole Singapore thing was just unneeded. While it did add a new element to the film, it just seemed too forced.

4) Running time was a tad bit long but it passed fairly quickly due to the great action sequences.

All in all .. I was impressed with the movie, but it has its problems. Much like part 2.

I say go and see it. You wont be disappointed but you wont walk out thinking you just saw a masterpiece either.

Just my thoughts ..."

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),Great film lives up to expectations.,"This movie is truly spectacular!!! Non stop action, with a surprising ending. If it weren't for the silliness of the Jack Sparrow clones, I would give it a 9 and 1/2. It takes a little away from the film's momentum. As far as the final battle rivaling that of the LOTR trilogy, I would say no. This trilogy will go down as one of the great trilogies. Breathtaking special effects, and fabulous scenery. All in all, a great film. It must be viewed in the theater. It is better than Dead Man's Chest, but I still like the overall story line of Curse of the Blach Pearl better. As always, be sure to stick around after the credits for an extra scene. This one adds to the plot of the film and gives viewers some closure after a heart wrenching finale. Make sure you check this film out.

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),"I wanted to like it, but...","It was very disappointing.

I adored the first movie to pieces. I own the DVD and regularly play it on movie nights with my friends. It's great unexpected fun, quotable, and a visual spectacle. The characters are surprisingly likable, and Depp comes roaring in like a breath of fresh air as Capt. Jack.

The problem with the third movie (as well as the second) is that it lost touch with it's roots. The first movie, while heavy with the supernatural stuff, was still pretty grounded in a fairly accurate real world. The characters were over the top, yes, but still believable, and above all, relatable. Their motives and predicaments all made a great deal of sense (i.e. Elizabeth wanting to marry Will, Barbossa wanting to be free of the curse, Jack simply wanting to get a boat so he could live his life of freedom). Unfortunately, in the new movies, the writers have lost touch with the first movie's charm. The plots are so convoluted it's difficult to decipher, much less remember, a character's desires and motives. It's much less emotionally grounded. It has also become so thick into this supernatural fantasy land that it has hardly any link to the real world at all. This would not have been a problem were the filmmakers not so intent on special effects and visual spectacles that they forgot to tell a good, solid story.

I believe this movie would have been better if the writers had kept to a more straightforward plot and toned down much of the ""grand spectacle"" stuff which really dominated the movies."
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),robbed by pirates :(,spoiler warning
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),Not bad,"Less than a year after the previous installment of the popular pirates trilogy, Jack Sparrow and company return in Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. The film should be great, given a three hundred million dollar budget, huge anticipation, and the closure a third installment inevitably brings to a series. While this film does show its budget and is quite visually arresting, it lacks a fair share of resolution to the trilogy and confuses with its overflowing exposition rather than purely existing to entertain.

Even in an action packed pirate movie, overly chatty sequences will simply bore audiences just because it's too hard to follow what exactly is being said. The movie really just had too many vague or unnecessary plot points that didn't affect the main plot at hand.

All the acting was perfectly fine, with Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow and Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbosa unsurprisingly being the standouts. The introduction of Depp's character in the pirate equivalent of Hell called Davy Jones' Locker is a particular favorite, as well as the scenes at World's End, which somehow involves a giant, deep waterfall. Keith Richards' hyped cameo as Jack's father is nothing to go crazy for, he does a decent job, but his screen time lasts only about two minutes.

Director Gore Verbinski and his crew knew going into this that the reviews would be mixed and the plot would be confusing (in order to encourage repeat viewings), but honestly, at nearly three hours, the more the film confuses you the more it becomes an endurance test. Also, rather than providing a satisfying conclusion to the series, the end opens up the possibility for a fourth installment, which might not even happen. The crew put every penny of the film's budget on screen, made evident in the hour or so of its bloated climax. The film looks and feels like a true epic, shots are wide, locations are vast, costumes are extravagant, and the scope is large. However, the film needs to scale down its plot in order to let the characters we fell in love with stand out and shine, as that's what makes these films unique."

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),"Despite its many flaws, the movie still left me hungry for more.","The Pirates of the Caribbean-movie serials is probably one I'll never grow tired off. The characters are fun and great, always adventurous and spectacular to watch.

It's really too bad that this time they felt the need to make things even bigger, more complex and conclusive than the previous two movies. Really not needed. In my opinion the first movie ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is still the best because of the reason that it's simple, fun and choices to be purely entertaining. They already went wrong with this approach during the second movie; ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"", when they put in more new characters and different hard to follow plot lines. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" goes on in the same trend as the previous movie. There are more new characters and as far as the new many plot-lines are concerned...well let me just say that after a while I just gave up trying to understand the movie and just let the movie take me away with its visuals, humor and other entertaining elements. And this movie regardless should really be able to take you away on a roller-coaster-ride of pure entertainment.

No doubt in my mind that this movie could had become the best one out of the series. It had all the potential and budget for that, now if they had only cut down about halve of the script...Most of the plot-lines seem redundant and are actually far from believable because they contradict from what happened in the first two movies. The many betrayals among characters and side-picking became really confusing after a while, till it reached a point when you just didn't knew who was fighting for what. But like I said before, after a while you just stop caring about it and simply enjoy the movie for what it brings you. It all is also the reason why the movie is now nearly 3 hours long. Now the movie is not as good and entertaining as the first but maybe just slightly better than the second one, because of the large scale of this movie.

The movie is definitely big. There is no lack of action as some people claim there is. There is just as much action as there is in the first two movies, only difference this time is that the movie is nearly 3 hours long and therefor the movie also has some more talking-sequences and slower moments in it.

The movie is also big with its musical score by Hans Zimmer and he actually succeeded in composing a new great theme for the movie. In its action moments the movie gets definitely uplifted by its musical score.

The action sequences are definitely well constructed and at times pure eye candy. So are the special effects, although I feel that the second movie was still better on that. It seems like they tried to overdo things this time and I'm mainly talking about the end battle, when it comes down to its special effects, by putting in some complex shots. No matter how good CGI is these days, you still see that it's CGI.

Most roles get extended in this movie. Marty, Tia Dalma and even Jack the monkey and Cotton's parrot. But of course the movie still remains the Jack Sparrow-show. Really one of the best characters in recent years, all thanks to Johnny Depp, who provide the movie with its biggest laughs and most hilarious absurd moments. He still plays the character as good and fresh as he did for the first time 4 years ago. You can't just ever grow tired of Jack Sparrow. I was also very pleased to see Geoffrey Rush back as Barbossa. His role was bigger which allowed Geoffrey Rush to shine even more. Bill Nighy was also as good as always as Davy Jones. Orlando Bloom's and Keira Knightley's acting also has really improved over the years. I was actually surprised to see how much of the movie Keira Knightley carries this time and how well she does this. Even in the sequences with Geoffrey Rush she does. She also gets to do more interesting in the movie when it comes done to action. In a way she has taken over the Will (Orlando Bloom) role in this movie this time and Will himself gets pushed more to the background this time compared to the first two movies, which really shouldn't bother most people, unless you're a teenage-girl of course. She handles both the action- and comical sequences really well. And even Keith Richards shows up in an already classic cameo as Jack's father. But some role also got narrowed down to my regret, such as Jonathan Pryce's and Jack Davenport's and lets not forget the Kraken.

Still, I really wouldn't mind seeing more Pirates of the Caribbean movies in the future, if needed with new actors and characters, as long as Johnny Depp stays as Jack Sparrow. The serials still have more than enough potential and haven't dried up yet.

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),Pirates 3 Out of this World!,"Do not listen to the stingy critics!! This movie is AMAZING! Everything you hoped for and more. I can't wait to see it again. The fact that it is a long movie makes it all the better for the viewer because you get more of all the adventure, romance and breathtaking scenes. The writing is incredible, the acting is the best it has been since the beginning, and the artistry is second-to-none. There is no fluff, every scene means something. It's funny, intriguing and keeps you on the edge of your seat. My heart didn't stop pounding until long after the credits ended. It's the kind of movie that stays with you. It's satisfying IF this is the last Pirates, and it leaves you wanting more IF we are to be blessed with a fourth. Bottom line is: go see this movie, and have a great time doing it!

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),Re-watch ability,"Overall, its a movie, pure entertainment. I loved it, it was fun to watch. I could sit here and delve into the plot and stuff but i would rather just take it as it is. And what it is:A funny action comedy with Johnny Depp appearing as the most memorable character of our time. If that wasn't enough then the screenplay is ""complicated"" for a reason, you can watch it over and over and it does not get old because you gain something else from it every time you re watch it.

The writers, director, and score all hit their mark in this one. The movie could last 3 more hours for all I care. All this movie does it make you want more.

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),Fitting Finale,"Just finished viewing a private screening of the final chapter of the Pirates of the Caribbean and can confirm it does not disappoint.

The original is still the best but 'At World's End' completes the trilogy on a high note.

Johnny Depp continues to shine as Captain Jack and Chow Yun Fat makes a huge impact as Captain Sao Feng. Academy Award winner Geoffrey Rush returns as Barbossa and his exclusion from most of the 2nd movie was the reason it was my least favorite out of the whole trilogy. Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom complete the All-star class and do an OK job as their respective characters.

The whole film build up to the final battle which is one of the finest since the Lord of the Rings.

If your a Pirates of the Carribbean Fan, this one is not to be missed.

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),As awesome a finale as anyone could have hoped for...,"If you, like me, were disappointed by the over-hyped, sloppy and disappointing returns of Shrek and Spiderman in the first two mega-threquels of the summer, then I have good news for you. One third entry in a huge cinema franchise is every bit as good as you would expect.

While lacking the surprise of the original, the third Pirates film is much better than the second (though I liked it, I thought it had too many jokes and gags; a lot of the heart in the first was missing it seemed). Its lengthier, and not in a slowed-down way. Longer meaning more action, more characters (Chow Yun Fat and Keith Richards are awesome), and a final battle so enriched with awesome design, careful choreography and stunning visual effects it will blow your mind.

The cast is great, the thrills all first-rate. I don't want to give away any of the surprises and great moments to die-hard fans like myself. Just trust me: this summer spend your buck on Pirates...it's worth it!!!!"

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),Pirates 3: Not a Disaster at All,"The third installment of Pirates of the Caribbean is not, as popularly believed, disastrous or incredibly confusing. At the very start of the movie I was hooked again.

The movie contains a lot of information to process, but if you actually sit down and follow it you'll find it is not confusing at all. As the third and hopefully not last Pirates of the Caribbean movie, I believe they did an excellent job. Although the movies have become more serious they are still funny and a lot of fun to watch.

Not only did this movie create another cliffhanger ending that leaves us wondering if there will be more but it also immortalized characters such as the famous Jack Sparrow.

I personally think that the second movie was not as bad as people said it was, it was also quite good. The third was definitely better, and allowed you to see the characters in a much different way.

So stop believing people when they say this movie wasn't good at all, it was excellent!"

Gore Verbinski is a Great Director, whose name will be written by gold letters near such names like Lucas and Leone. I'm not sure that somebody see in him great master before this film. But it's happened, and the world has got new live classic. My congratulations for us!!! Excellent!!! This film is my strongest impression, which I've got watching Hollywood film this year. Depp is the best of the best, but in the third part of ""Pirates"" I can tell some pleasant words for Keira Knightley and even for Orlando. Well, I think that next main Oscars already found its owners.

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),Movie Review: Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is the third and last of the money spinning trilogy, or so they say. Everything has led to this, or so they say again and I kept my mind opened. The first of the Pirates series, The Curse of the Black Pearl was good. It was a movie out of nothing or more correctly a movie inspired by nothing more than a Disney theme park ride. Having said that however the creation of Captain Jack Sparrow was nothing short of inspirational. Captain Jack played by the charismatic Johnny Depp became the talisman of Pirates of the Caribbean. Thought to be dead when we saw him charging into the jaws of monster octopus Kraken toward the end of Dead Man's Chest (the sequel), he is to be brought back from the dead in this latest film.

I have to be honest; I hated Dead Man's Chest. Its various plots and subplots were terribly tangled and confusing. It was hard to follow what sort of story or motives the movie wants to say. I blamed my lack of understanding for not comprehending Dead Man's Chest. That was summer of last year but since then I have done my research, for the billion dollars making movie was to have a third installment. Having seen one and two, I have to see three. But if I do not understand two then how can I go ahead with three. And so after a better understanding of two I saw three. You should know this. For all my efforts I was still robbed by the pirates.

I was led happily out into the open sea before being robbed. I was enjoying the first third of the 168 minutes film. Captain Jack's crew arrived in Singapore to look for Captain Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fatt), pirate lord of the South China Sea for a ship and a map, so they could sail to world's end and rescue our favourite captain from Davy Jones's Locker. Davy Jones's Locker is a ghost realm of the netherworld where the dead Captain Jack Sparrow is being kept for eternity.

There appears to be some oriental influence in At World's End. Firstly of course we are introduced to a Chinese pirate, Captain Sao Feng. Secondly, the costumes and all were very well designed in an exquisite oriental fashion. And there was Singapore, a South East Asian country where Captain Sao Feng can be found.

The Singapore set features a bathhouse and I couldn't help relating it to Japanese animation master Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away. The popular animated film, released by Disney in the west has a bathhouse theme. The relation did not stop there, and I wondered if the scene where Captain Jack Sparrow is isolated in Davy Jones's Locker was inspired too by Hayao Miyazaki's work. The part where thousands of strange and curious yet harmless rounded stone-like crab helping Jack move his ship, The Black Pearl across a desert aroused my attention to this perspective. It was through the hands, eyes and imagination of the acclaimed animation master, Hayao Miyazaki that made famous the approach of detailing stories with thousands of mini little intriguing creatures. And it was fun to watch.

I was enjoying At World's End, laughing merrily at all the pirate jokes that the characters are lashing out at one another, feeling the thrill of the sword-fights and of course attracted to the sometimes witty, looney and mad character of Captain Jack Sparrow. That scene of him engaging himself to his many different personalities while alone in the deserted Davy Jones's Locker is a real gem.

But with all the oriental influences, the filmmakers probably did not take note of the teachings of Zen, where less is truly more. For when after the crew rescued Captain Jack Sparrow and brought him back to the mortal world, it all happened again. The tangling and confusing plots and subplots manifested once more and killed whatever is good about the film. In my opinion, if At World's End had ended after rescuing Captain Jack and had a straight approach in the gathering of forces to deal with Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) and Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) with a fitting spectacle of a finale fight, the film would have been great.

I was trying to understand the story. In reflection I probably should not for it amounted to nothing. It just isn't worth it. It would be tiring for me just to list them all out. So just be warned that in the film, every character have their own personal agenda. It is ""me"" first and ""you"" later if ""you"" are still there. If that is the purpose of the story-writers to represent the meaning of how pirates are, then they have succeeded. In fact it was so successful that they lost me.

It bored me so much I no longer laughed at the jokes. It dragged on so long I no longer felt compelled to see the ending. I just want the film to end there and then. Enough was enough.

""Take whatever you can and give nothing back."" Thanks a billion, filmmakers, or is it thanks me instead?

This entire Pirate series is like a ride on a pirate ship in a theme park, it was thrilling for a start but as it swing back and forth too many times the nauseas will come and when it stops you find yourself displaced nowhere.

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is a fine example of a good film gone bad because it had too many tangling tales to tell. I maintain that it is worth watching for the first third of the film but save yourself from seasickness in the middle just so you can enjoy the spectacular fight sequence toward the end."
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),Amazing and Brilliant....,"I will admit. I went in to this movie, the last of three, with the belief it would be great. I loved the first and was excited to see that the second was even better. Now I have seen the third and have to say again that I loved it even more than the others. Many times you go in to a movie with high hopes only to walk out disappointed and angry. This is not the case with the new ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End."" I was lucky enough to get a pass to an exclusive Pre-Screening here in Jacksonville, Fl. I was planning on staying up to see it Thursday night as soon as the first movie hit the screens and am happy for the chance I received. Upon entering the theatre I was excited, especially after waiting in line for two hours. As soon as the movie started my excitement grew to colossus levels. The movie starts with a good old fashion pirates Yo Ho. It continued to surprise me and enthrall me in its wondrous beauty and imaginative world of pirating and swashbuckling. Pirates 3 evokes many responses from its crowd including excitement, laughter and tears. There are parts that make you sit on the edge of your seat while other times you sit back enthralled in the romance.

This movie brings you in, warms you up, coddles you, and lets you go with the knowledge you have been part of something great."
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),"A reasonably fitting ""end""","Once you start downhill, it's difficult to halt the momentum. So to apply this metaphor to the world of cinema, once a film franchise delivers a poor entry, it's almost impossible to not deliver poor ones from then on out. So, imagine the surprise when, after the lackluster Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, that screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio and director Gore Verbinski are able to deliver a superior third entry in the Pirates series with Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. It is hardly perfect, still far too long and lacking in emotional depth, but for a summer spectacle, it still manages to deliver the goods to a degree.

At World's End opens not long after Dead Man's Chest, with Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly) joining forces with recently resurrected Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) to rescue Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) from Davy Jones' locker, where he was dragged to by the Kraken at the conclusion of the last film. While they are on their way to the afterlife, Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), has exerted his influence over Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) and is using him to bring the pirates of the world to their knees. With their very existence on the line, the pirate lords meet to discuss the possibility of joining forces to combat Beckett, but since these are pirates, there is a wide variety of skullduggery and backstabbing to be had.

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is rife with dazzling visuals. As with both previous films, At World's End has spent it's almost-certainly astronomical budget on what actually goes on the screen. The sets, costumes, and stunning visual effects are impressive, to say the least. You might be excused for actually believing that what you are seeing is real at times, not just movie trickery. The make-up artists have also once again proved that they can be the go to guys for the creation of unappealing looking characters, as almost no one in Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End looks like they have taken a bath or brushed their teeth, well, ever, which, in this case, seems to work for the film. If you want to see a visually spectacular motion picture, especially on the big screen, you need look no further than At World's End.

On the other hand, if you are interested in depth to go along with the glittery outside, then At World's End will prove to be somewhat lacking, although not nearly as much as Dead Man's Chest. The key problem to this film is that the characters are underdeveloped. Most of what makes them up is played out again without much added to the proceedings from the previous entries: Jack wants everything for himself, Barbossa wants what Jacks wants also, Will wants Elizabeth and Elizabeth wants, seemingly, to be a pirate. Frankly, it's a bit sad that the character with one of the best emotional arcs in the film is one of its villains, Davy Jones, who has an almost touching degree of pathos added to him thanks to a scene about halfway through the film. Perhaps it is the film's never ending attempt to keep the audience uncertain where the various characters loyalties lie that also works against the audiences' identification with almost anyone. When it seems that everyone is out only for themselves, it's hard to work up much enthusiasm for them.

The film's cardinal sin, as has been the case with every Pirates entry thus far, is its bloated length. At World's End does not have nearly the lopsided running time to substance ratio that Dead Man's Chest did, but it still overstays it's welcome. Much like fellow summer blockbuster Spider-Man 3, the filmmakers seem to believe that bigger is better, and that is sometimes just not the case. In the film's defense, there is quite of bit of plot to fill the minutes, but it could have still been trimmed back to some degree while maintaining, and perhaps even increasing, the entertainment value.

That being said, At World's End still manages a few surprises, and the ending does pay off much of what has gone before, and even though the ""love"" between Elizabeth and Will seems almost non-existent, a key scene at the end on a beach does manage to be effective. The actors also generally deliver once again. Johnny Depp is entertaining as ever as Jack Sparrow, although he finds the screen time a bit split amongst the various other characters this outing. Depp seems to be having a good time in the role, and it's hard to not understand his public statements that he would be willing to go more rounds as the character. Rush is also effective as Barbossa and Keira Knightley shows a bit more energy than in the last entry, as does Orlando Bloom in the part of Will.

So, what began as a seemingly bad idea (a Disney theme park ride turned into a summer film) has concluded three films later with one of biggest displays of blockbuster film-making, in terms of scope, as has been seen in recent years. That the spectacle isn't quite in service of an appropriate amount of core material is disappointing, but Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is hardly a loss. It provides a decent amount of entertainment, buckets of eye candy and a good laugh here and there. While filmmakers should perhaps aspire to more, what they manage deliver isn't half bad. I suppose that might sound like damning with faint praise, but you just have to call them as you see them."
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),Excellent... The best action / fantasy film,"I absolutely loved this film. It sucked you in right from the beginning and held you to the very end(make sure wait through the screen credits). The(real)photography was beautiful with stunning locations. The CG was some of the best I've seen. This film is often bright and pleasing to the eye unlike many others. Special effects?? awesome! The sets / ships were proof of the attention to detail of the art and construction departments. The story and the way it was acted out just couldn't have been better. It was exciting, maybe a little scary for the little ones and often times very funny. I can't imagine the amount of research involved putting this all together.

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),What did they do to this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"During the first movie they had an undead pirate crew. During the second movie they topped it with Davy Jones and a mutant fish crew. During the third movie, they had a god that was built up and did absolutely nothing, a crew from Singapore that wasn't cool and quickly faded out of memory, and a wicked evil navel captain that froze up in the heat of battle at the end.

There was no conclusion between Davy Jones and Calypso. There wasn't a love scene at all between Jack and Elizabeth, even though it was perfectly set up to have one. The Cracken had a non existent death.

There are so many other crappy parts to this script...

The first movie was amazing, the second one topped the first, the third one is the biggest pile I have ever seen. It was a massive disappointment."
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),Only for the most die-hard fans of the previous two,"I don't know how anyone, cast and crew included, could think that 3 hours is a good length for this film. The film could be drastically improved--but not saved--by cutting out an hour. Or maybe even an hour and a half. And that is not a complaint that I have too often. I don't mind long movies. But this one just drags and drags and drags. And I don't mind slow movies either. But the ""plot""--if you can even call it that--is much too convoluted. There are too many things going on at any given time for you too actually care what happens to any of the characters.

And if you haven't seen the first two films, do not see this one. You will have no idea what is going on. You would think that with 3 hours the writers could properly introduce you to all of the characters. But you would be wrong.

Obviously, this movie will have a huge opening weekend. But look for it to drastically drop off on its second weekend as word of mouth spreads. Just like Spider-Man 3.

This movie epitomizes everything wrong with Hollywood today. There is way too much time spent on over-the-top action. And almost no time spent on characterization. Every year movie theater attendance goes down, and every year ticket prices go up. And this film will only worsen that problem. There will be tons of people who walk out of the theater and say ""That definitely wasn't worth my time or money."" And it will probably be a while before they make a trip to the theater again.

If the major studios would concentrate on making quality films, every thing else would take care of itself."
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),A fine ending!,"This is a fantastic ending to a great trilogy. I know many were disappointed with the 2nd installment, but you will not be disappointed by this one! I think it's equivalent to the 1st in quality.

The battle scenes are AMAZING and the new and old characters are perfect. Johnny Depp delivers as usual but the addition of Keith Richards as his dad sealed the deal (at least for me anyway). The twists and turns of this movie keep you guessing and sitting at the edge of your seat.

THIS IS A MOVIE NOT TO BE MISSED!!!

***there is a scene at the end of the credits so don't forget to stay!!!!

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),2 1/2 Hours Of My Life I'll Never Get Back!!!,"I noticed a comment in the trivia section for the movie ""Filming was started without a finished script."" I think that about says it all for me. If you put 1000 monkeys in front of 1000 typewriters for 100 years, the script for this movie would be what you would get from their efforts. What a crappy, noisy, confusing bunch of overdone special effects. I only went to see it because my husband wanted to. And for the record, I LOVED the first movie! Why do they always have to make sequels? Hmmm...oh I forgot, to make more MONEY!!! Not only is the plot confusing, but the whole movie is visually repulsive. Everything and everyone is slimy, sweaty, dirty, and have rotten teeth (except of course for the lovely two leads, who have to be pretty and dirty at the same time.) I was exhausted and drained at the end of the movie. A quote from Shakespeare comes to mind ""Sound and fury, signifying nothing"" Please, don't make a fourth movie Hollywood, I can't take any more.

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),"part 1 and 2 were great, part 3 is a big disappointment",spoiler warning
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),'At World's End': How to blow several million dollars without breaking a sweat.,"The third movie in this series is truly a lazy effort from all involved. The story is mundane, unimaginative and basically a rehash of what we have already learned from 'Dead Man's Chest'. For a family adventure movie it is unforgivably boring, with long sections of humming & hawing punctuated only by brief action sequences that look like they've been shot by the 2nd Unit director in a couple of hours.

The humor has been reduced to catchphrases, the script forcing Johnny Depp grind a likable character into the dust until it's nothing more than tiresome. The special effects while still excellent (notably Davy Jones' tentacles) offer nothing more than what we have already seen in the first two movies, and certainly nothing with even half the imagination of the original's moonlight skeletons. In a 3 hour 'event' movie it's shocking that not a single set-piece was in anyway noteworthy, from stunted opener to fizzling finale.

Geoffrey Rush deserves an honorable mention for keeping me in my seat during what has to be one of the most contrived love scenes I've ever witnessed. His performance as Barbossa, the quintessential pirate is deserving of a far better movie. This alone will earn 'At World's End' its one star, but yet I still can't help feeling like I'm being ripped off."
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),"Bloated and overrated,","I went to see the 9:30 show yesterday with five friends, and we were pumped. Actually, they were, since I had the feeling that Pirates 3 would end up as another Pirates 2: too long, special-effect heavy, and a nonsensical plot that passed itself as being ""heavy"" but making no sense.

Yes, the movie opens up perfectly, and offers hope. But after that, the movie goes down. Way down. There's all these little things flying around that try to come together, but most of the time I was scratching my head, despite having seen the previous two movies.

There is, of course, bright spots. When Johnny Depp FINALLY comes back, the movie becomes more interesting. The English antagonist is decidedly evil and plotting, and there are back stabs throughout the movie.

Really, it aspires to be an epic pirate movie, but there's too much wind for its sails.

There are some awe-inspiring and epic scenes, no doubt, but the movie as a whole will leave anyone but the most die-hard fans (which by from the ratings are many) wanting to walk this Pirate's plank."
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),What a pile of old rubbish,"Honestly I walked out after 45 minutes and went to the pub because even me, yes me, 'Mr. Over Analyser Of Films' completely lost what the heck was going on and quiet frankly once you've seen the first one (which was the best), you've seen them all because the 2 sequels (especially this one) are over indulgent, misdirected bilge.

The thing that makes me laugh is that whenever they interview one of the cast, they always say something along the lines of, 'oooo, i'll do it if the script is good enough!' Did you not actually read the script for the first too sequels or were you too blinded by the cheques for several million dollars? Sell outs!

I would like to apologise to my bottom on which I had to sit while taking in this insult to the film industry.

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),Quite Possibly The Worst Action Movie Ever Made,spoiler warning
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),Am I ten years old??,"I've seen Bugs Bunny cartoons with more plot and story line...I'm not getting it. I loved the first of this trilogy; I was somewhat entertained by the second; but this one??? Have we come to this as a society? It seems like every time I get stoked enough to go to a movie theater to watch a ""can't miss"" piece of entertainment, I get disappointed. This is childish at best...targeting those with the ten second attention span. Great effects; terrible or no plot; terrible or no story line; average to below average acting. I'm just amazed at the 7 of 10 overall star rating this cartoon is getting here??? What have we become? SHEEP! I'd give it zero stars if it were an option.

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),I loved every moment,"Nearly the entire time, I was on the edge of my seat in the theater just in total awe. The imagery was beautiful and the action was great in my opinion. I've heard some people say there were too many forced laughs, but when I went with my friends, we only chuckled maybe 3 times. Same for everyone else in the theater. Sure, there were a few laughs, but to me it seemed like this movie was more serious than the other two. It may have been a little fast-paced, but they had a lot to wrap up. I loved the bittersweet ending. Remember to stay after the credits for an extra scene. All in all, I thought it was a great film and one with great replay value. I'll definitely be buying this on DVD, perhaps even going back to the theater for more viewings.

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),Captain Jack Sparrow steals the show (again).,spoiler warning
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),A proper epic  the best part of the trilogy.,"The first two movies were warm-up. Setting up the mythology, background, characters and gags. This is the big payoff. And it works so well.

There are oft repeated complaints about the movie  too much stuff/plot/characters, a lot of talk and repetition of things already done in the previous movies. Actually, these are the movies strengths.

It's a movie by fans, for fans. Well, I'm not sure if these are the proper terms it's a movie by someone who loves the setting and characters, for people who love the setting and characters. It rewards you for paying attention to minute details, including those from the last movies, as well as character motivation and mythology. It does not reward ignoring the ""talky"" parts while waiting for the next action sequence and then getting confused about the ""overtly intricate"" plot.

Yes, nearly every plot hook, character, and plenty of gags from the last movies are brought up again. The plot threads are more or less neatly tied together, each character gets the fate s/he deserves and the gags ah, those, are where the movie really inherits a great boon from the last two films. Each gag is used once or twice, to the fullest potential, and then dismissed before it overstays its welcome, or taken into an entirely new context. Only with that kind of legacy can a movie send an audience into fits of laughter merely by having a character beckon a dog to him and say ""Sea Turtles"".

Every element has been fine tuned to near perfection. There's only one full blown swashbuckling/naval combat scene  at the climax, where it belongs. And having waited an entire movie for it, I find it hard to imagine an audience member that would not be overwhelmed and swept along. All the double, triple and quadruple crosses are in place, and they are fascinating. Not only are you always unsure of just which side each character is playing, but the negotiation and parlay scenes are filmed in the same manner as the action scenes  and it WORKS.

Comparisons to Return of the King are nearly inevitable, regarding various aspects of the film, but the most pretient, in my opinion is that this is the first movie in the series which actually creates the feeling that the heroes and the action are in another world, one of swashbuckling myth and wonder - the sort of feeling you got from any given LoTR movie.

Another RotK comparison (as well as a favorable comparison to the first two Pirate movies) - the movie is long. Some scenes could have been shorter. But there are absolutely no scenes that feel as though they are going on too long. There are no ""fight on the wheel"" or ""drowning Will"" scenes that go ""meanwhile, are heroes are doing the exact same thing they've been doing for the last 5 minutes"".

Shortcomings? The huge chunk of unwieldy exposition shoved into the beginning of the movie, a bit of overacting from Rush, and Chow Yun-Fat's characters should have been given more to do, or cut out altogether. Other than that, this film is excellent, and a fitting end to the trilogy, right down to the humorous/bittersweet/ the road goes ever on and on, ending."
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),This film is terrible,"To go and see this film would be a mistake. To see it twice would be an insult to any great film ever made. To see it a third time would most likely induce an uncontrollable fit of vomiting. This film is disgustingly, uproariously bad.

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End stands as a stoic testament to the fact the millions of dollars worth of CGI B.S. doesn't equate to a worthwhile film. The plot of this film becomes so uselessly and uninterestingly convoluted that I wished my seat at the cinema had an ejector button. It isn't wonderfully convoluted like ""The Big Sleep"" or any other noted Film Noir, but rather the twisted, intangible web of double crosses and love dodecagons drags the film along tediously until its undeniably bathetic ending.

The acting in this film is, at times, laughably terrible. Depp, as usual, is able to carry the weight of his role as is a competent Rush. Keira Knightly's acting is painfully bad. This is as simply as I can put it. Orlando Bloom does his darnedest to make everything sound dramatic and manages to maintain a squint for approximately 80% of the film's arduous duration so I have to give him an E for effort. It's a sad day in film-land when two day-players acting as 'wenches' give a more memorable performance than two of the main characters.

If one were to make a documentary that drew attention to this film's every flat joke, empty promise and dismal piece of acting, it would be longer than the film itself, impossible as this may sound."
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),Great Finale to a Great Franchise and Summer Flick that didn't let me down,"Pirates 3 had everything I wanted out of a summer popcorn movie: great laughs, cool effects, interesting characters, bizarre plots, etc. The film will make you laugh from start to finish from the sexual side jokes to the crazy interactions between Jack and Barbossa. Again, Disney can wow an audience with believable effects, especially the grand finale and final battle. Hint: Better than the Battle of Gondor in LOTR: Return of the King. Johnny Depp is, as usual, fantastic as Jack Sparrow with the rest of the backstabbing cast members. Which brings us to one of the most complex and bizarre plot lines I've seen, but at the same time, very imaginative and entertaining. Also, for those of you that hear others complaining about the ending, please wait until the END of the film to see what really happens.

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),"yo-ho, yo-ho, a pirate's life for me!","When I first saw the film, I was confused by all the constant betrayals amongst the pirates, but then I remembered what Chow-Yun Fat's character said: The only way for a pirate to survive today is to betray other pirates. Everyone has their own agenda, yet they fight for a common purpose: To defeat Beckett and Davy Jones.

Make no mistake, they do so in a thrilling final battle that puts war movies to shame. Those who complain of the lack of Jack in the 2nd one will not be disappointed. In fact, they might find there's a little too much of him! Keira Knightley has brilliant moments, and looks even more beautiful than before. And as always, Barbosa and Jack make the perfect duo. The ending has great twists and are unlike a Disney film. They really do an excellent job of avoiding any clichés.

The visual effects are stunning, the acting is superb, and once more the final battle, as well as the score, is godly. Fans of the first two will not be disappointed for this truly is the finest of the trilogy. It is by far the fastest 3 hours you'll ever watch and at the end you'll only be wanting more!"
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),The plot thickens.... into a cement like mixture that is impossible to wade through.,"I think the one thing that actually made me angry about this movie is the way it insults our viewing intelligence. Throw a lot of special effects, big stars, and some clout produced by the first movie and what do you have? Well... not a whole hell of a lot. The plot is convoluted from the get go, the story lines become inane, and the special effects - actually those are pretty good. Let's just say that in three hours time a person could nearly make a trip from London to New York and they would still see more entertainment were they to look out their window. Half way through the film I asked those sitting to my left if they were as confused and disappointed as I was. They were and so I was somewhat vindicated in my response. Among my points of contention are these:

I have not seen such a complicated and unbelievable love story since Pearl Harbor. Davy Jones is suddenly not the scary sea monster/pirate but more of a cuckolded seafaring diplomat. Captain Jack Sparrow, who nearly carried the first film, is reduced to a supporting character. Why are we suddenly learning that all of these pirates to whom we were introduced in the first movie are part of a Lord Council?"
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),A Splendid Close to a Splendid Trilogy,"I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to view ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" in its first showing in my home town. I had been looking forward to this film ever since I had seen the first showing of ""Dead Man's Chest"". I felt like with Barbossa's cliffhanging return, the creators of the ""POTC"" films were promising their beloved fans something truly fantastic in the third film. Personally, I feel that they delivered on this promise. As I do not want to put any spoilers in my comments I will simply just say that all of the major questions are answered in a most satisfying and creative manner. There are, however, a crop of new questions that have been left for audience members to figure out on their own. I don't believe like these questions were left open for a possible fourth film (lets not all beat a dead horse), but I think they serve as a delightful ""fill in the blanks"" situation for viewers. Its almost as if one leaves the theater feeling like our beloved pirate friends are still out at sea, having the most marvelous of adventures.

As always, this film boasts an impressive lineup of performers. There is always the ever brilliant Johnny Depp who is as fantastic as ever in his role of Captain Jack Sparrow, the handsome Orlando Bloom who showed some great progress and confidence in his delivery of the role of young William Turner and the feisty and adventurous Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann. Other notable performances in the film can be found with Geoffrey Rush's crazed Captain Barbossa, a particular favorite of mine and a touching performance my Naomi Harris as the mysterious Tia Dalma. Add a splash of Keith Richards in an unforgettable cameo, Chow Yun Fat, and some Murtog and Mulroy and there you have it.

As a compliment to this constantly high-energy cast we have the usual full blown sets and computer graphics as can be expected in any Disney film. I truly reveled in the sets, stunts, and costumes as well as a stunning musical score composed by Hans Zimmer.

All of these wonderful elements come together in the final 40 minutes of the film. Again, I don't want to put any spoilers in this commentary, but I assure you, this film really does not disappoint."
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),Poor (almost all round) with great visual effects,"Poor (well no) story, wooden acting, inappropriate for age-group (well do you want your kids to see others hanging), with only one redeeming feature, super CGI!

Jonnhy Dep - obviously doing it in his sleep. Kiera - well it would be useful if she could act but she might learn. Orlando 'just call me wooden' - not a hope I'm afraid. Keef Richards - the best of them all.

It's over long, plot less (almost), a great money spinner but almost immediately forgettable. When can directors/producers stop treating their audiences as morons - I suppose I know the answer really - when they stop coming to this trash.

I took a couple of (older) kids under some pressure and deeply regretted it.

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),Pirates III: how NOT to make a trilogy,"And so it is proved, once again, that making a good trilogy isn't easy.

Sure, they did a good job in further repeating the now already 'typical pirates humor', portraying Sparrow as the somewhat clumsy yet always charming captain and, well, once again Keira was there to please the male eye. All of this probably because they hoped that this way we wouldn't notice that pirates III actually has... well... no story to it.

The same thing we saw happening with The Matrix: first movie is new, original and has a little something for everyone, in the second one they re-use the story, but add just a little twist and cover it all up with good visual effects. And come the third one, they've got no story left to tell and set the bar so high for themselves it's nearly impossible to reach it anymore, so they just fall back on the old reliable 'success of the other two movies'.

One thing I actually did like were the visual effects, and the amount of detail found in every single scene. That obviously took a lot of time and effort. Too bad that after seeing an army of undead pirates walking on the bottom of the ocean in the first movie, and a whole crew of half-man-half-sea-creatures in the second one, expectations were so high I was bound to being disappointed.

Yeah, nice locations too, again very detailed and everything, but I'm almost sorry I even noticed that, for my intentions were actually to follow the story (you know, tie all those loose ends Pirates I and II left us with) but all I heard coming out of the actor's mouths was ""blablabla *insert typical Jack Sparrow quote here* blabla"" As for the action scenes I can be quite brief: the first two movies they almost had me believing it just might even be possible (the three-man-fight on the big wheel in Pirates II not included), but this time they obviously got carried away. Even a child who 'wants to be a pirate when he grows up, just like captain Sparrow' will go out to find a more credible role model after seeing this movie.

All in all, I rated the movie 5 out of 10. They put a lot of work into the visual aspect of it all, but failed to live up to all the rest of my expectations."
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),Disgustingly bad,"It's disgusting how the makers of this film milked the fans for so much money and provided a substandard job. The first film was the best one I had ever seen with a nice grounding in historical realism but then the awesome supernatural parts. I enjoyed the second one too, not as much, but this was really bad. The writers seemed like they had been reading too much fan fiction. Chow-Yun Fat was brought in, prominently advertised, and then barely used. Strange, unbelievable ideas (a pirate brethren? wtf?) were brought into play just to fix up plot points, in fact most characters and parts were just brought into play to fix up plot points which had been created earlier and suddenly needed to be resolved. I had been expecting a happy ending and it wasn't as I thought, but that ended up leaving me disappointing. And it was too long.

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),Boring!!!,"Don't waste your money on either seeing the movie or DVD. This film takes great actors, in particular Geoffry Rush, and trashes their collective talents. Like most sequels, especially the third sequel this film lacks everything that was good in the others. Humourless, plot less, confused and incongruous and totally unbelievable this version is a complete dud. If there is a script it is yet to be found, and when found the scriptwriters should hang their heads in shame. Running for 168 minutes, 167 minutes too long, the best part is the credits at the end. Save your money and go out and rent a good Errol Flynn pirate movie.

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),The first movie I ever walked out of.,"When I think back to May 18th when I first saw ""Shrek The Third,"" I laugh at myself for thinking there couldn't be another worse film made in 2007. Well tonight I was shut up, speechless, and left baffled as I took my seat at the 7:00 showing of ""Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End."" I will honestly tell you I only saw the first two hours of the film. At 9:00 I grabbed my value Pepsi and practically ran out the theater door, eager to escape the hell I had so innocently trapped myself in on a valuable Friday night.

There are so many things wrong with this film I don't even know where to start. Just like the third Shrek installment, POTC 3 has lost all--and I mean all--of its charm and has now turned into a 3 hour soul-less bloodthirsty action movie with no character development, horrible acting, very few charming Jack Sparrow moments, and just a bunch of angry sea creature pirates eating each other's heads and stabbing swords through other unlucky pirates' torsos.

The acting was absolutely horrid. Orlando Bloom is in his worst role of his career and gives a painfully annoying performance as Will Turner. Kiera Knightley, an actress who I usually adore watching on screen, was also surprisingly below average and left me wondering what the hell went wrong on the set of this movie. Even veterans Johnny Depp, Bill Nighy, and Geoffrey Rush seemed bored by the whole thing, like they knew the movie sucked but also their contracts with their signatures on it kept them from ducking out of the project.

There's too much CGI. WAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY too much CGI. Part of the reason I loved the first film so much was because it was reasonably realistic, no huge sea creatures, no hammerhead shark pirates, no strange women growing 10000x their size, roaring like some guy from a death metal band, and then falling apart into crabs. There was no unnecessary CGI. The third film excels at this, and it almost felt like I was watching a Star Wars film. Unfortunately, the excess CGI takes away from the backbone of the film, and is obviously a huge weight on the film that only attributes to it's faceplant into the ground.

Gore Verbinski really is starting to lose his magic as well. He did an EXCELLENT job directing the first film, and did a pretty good job with the direction of the second film. Why, now, does he deliver a terribly amateurish directing job in the third film? It was almost as bad as the direction in Clint Eastwood's ""Flags of our Fathers."" The storyline is ridiculously stupid and stupidly hollow, incredibly and overly complex for a fun popcorn movie like this, and Verbinski tries to balance three separate story lines on one plate and ends up dropping the dishes, spoiling the food, and leaving the viewer hungry.

I could really go on and on about what a gigantic waste of time and money this film is, but a movie like this doesn't deserve such a long review. Really, it's a shame Hollywood relies on sequels to big moneymaking blockbusters to rake in the cash these days. Thank God for indie cinema. Save your money and rent the first instead, which is actually a 9 or 10 in my book."
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),Simple AWFUL!,spoiler warning
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),You Know What? It's Absolutely Fun.,"I was a complete sucker for the effects this time. I have grown to dislike franchise films based on the starving and then desperately feeding sweets to mainstream American audiences, the sweets being computer-generated visual effects. Well, this one got me. Gore Verbinski, the director of all three films in the Pirates of the Caribbean series, has a deep, intuitive understanding of the fear, drama, and peace that can be derived from water. The film may not have the brilliantly elaborate sword fights that its predecessors had, but there are many unbelievably dazzling sequences involving pirate ships and the effects the gargantuan ocean has upon them. Horizons, whirlpools, the deep, reflections of the starry night sky, and waterfalls all have their heydays in this epic pleasure of a glossy Hollywood film.

The story is an extensive, elaborate, complicated, extremely verbose one, and most adolescents and children prone to Disney films will often find themselves lost. That is no judgment on their intelligence, only on the expectations the writers have of their target audience. I, however, thought the story hardly left anything to be desired. The fantasy elements of the series are induced with great creativity, as opposed to many fantasy films, which usually tend to have stories that center around incidentally fantastical worlds, with invented creatures, completely objective goals like finding a ring that controls the fate of a race of beings. The Pirates films are actually heavy on plot, and in this third installment, the travel between this world and the afterlife in Davy Jones's Locker is cleverly done. The humor is also becoming more daring, with cynicism, and extreme dryness that is not R-rated, but gives off vibes as though it is.

Johnny Depp has become such a sizzling hot property, and since his nuclear burst of popularity in 2003 has widdled to a universal liking by all and a box office fueled by a stalker's obsession among angsty 13-year-old girls, that the filmmakers have become extremely self-conscious in their handling of Captain Jack Sparrow. I was impressed very much by his introduction in At World's End, which was very fresh and not so corny emerging from a coffin with his guns in his hands across his chest so that the audience can cheer. It brims with happy-go-lucky creativity, but the gimmick is carried too far by being continued and built upon in several scenes throughout the rest of the movie. But I won't deny that there are points where it gets interesting. If I'm being vague, it's because I don't want to spoil it.

One thing I'm definitely becoming concerned about is the amount of violence that's being allowed in Disney films. Smokin' Aces was released in January, and it was a mêlée of grinding, shrieking action violence complete with several gruesome shootouts and a couple of snippets of torture. It was rated R, and no, it was not released by Walt Disney Pictures, but by the standards being set by this film, which opens with a child amongst a line of condemned being prepared for hanging and has a surprisingly disturbing scene wherein Davy Jones's tentacles impale a single man's head through each orifice, it very well could be. During Smokin' Aces, or any other R-rated action film recently, I was not disturbed, and did not make an irksome face, at any violent scene, though several are shown and the body counts are high. In this PG-13-rated film, there were three sequences where I grimaced. Why would the violence be harder in a film designed for kids that is given a much more generous rating than a film designed for older people that is given a very standard rating that is given away like confetti at a parade? Anyway, the verdict is that it is one vastly entertaining epic ride where the characters, as they always are in the Pirates films, maintain an interesting and hairpin-turning arch throughout the series, and the performances by Depp and Geoffrey Rush are as charming as ever. This is coming from a film buff who begrudges billion-dollar franchises founded upon treating audiences like junkies who are so numb and disabled that all they are able to eat now is ice cream."
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),"You're kidding me, right?","It's like 150 people were told, ""You can each write 1 minute of the screenplay"", but no one was allowed to see what anyone else was writing; and then those little bits of script were all tossed into a blender, mixed on ""high"" for about a week, and finally splorked out onto the screen like a drunk sailor's vomit in stormy seas. Whoever the ""continuity"" person was for POTC3 should be keelhauled, drawn and quartered, hanged from a yardarm, then forced to have dinner with Gilbert Gottfried at a cheap taco joint called ""The Alley Cat Tortilla"".

In case it's not clear by now, what I'm saying is that THIS THING MADE NO SENSE. Is ""comprehensible plot"" no longer a viable concept? Has Hollywood finally come out and admitted that they'll make only one good movie, then churn out a mess (literally) of crappy sequels, knowing that their investment will make them big bucks no matter what? I hope to Poseidon that Johnny Depp is still smacking himself for ever agreeing to making this piece of trash.

And while I'm in the mood, politically incorrect as it may be, a skinny, diminutive, pouty-lipped blond won't be a convincing swashbuckler no matter HOW MUCH SHE BELLOWS!

For what it's worth, I loved the first POTC, tolerated the 2nd, and am a big pirate fan, in that I own my own swashbuckler costume, as well as a copy of ""Treasure Island"", have been spewing Robert Newtonish ""piratese"" for literally decades, and observe ""Talk Like A Pirate Day"" as my favorite holiday. So don't go thinking I didn't like this because I don't like pirates."
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),I would rather watch a turd in a hat!,"The title sums it up - you people who endured this torrid mess of a trilogy lived sheltered lives or have seen very few films outside of the blockbuster section - inclusive of star wars and lord of the rings. Predictable dialogue, stupid editing, extremely under acted or over acted by the likes of kiera knightley and Orlando (how the f@@k does he get work) Bloom. Simply put I could watch a turd in a hat and get more enjoyment for nearly three irritating hours of absolute ...................., just take away the hat and you get what I mean! It was a rushed marketing job of a franchise that tried to rely on Depp, and it couldn't, as much as I think Johnny Depp is a legend, not even he can save this sinking ship!!! And don't get me started on the tipping over of the ship - OMG how blooming ridiculous!!!! Please create a film with wit, intelligence, action and not utter stupidity!!!! What ever next, POTC 4: Revenge of the rock crabs - oh yes I didn't forget about you stupid little things - f'in rock crabs - please - a waste of CGI - I cant waste anymore time of this film - be gone to David Johnson's locker or whatever its called!!!

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),"Jack Sparrow returns, though not nearly enough for my tastes.","On par with Dead Man's Chest, not as good as the first part three still offers a very wild ride. The main problem, I have never had a harder time trying to keep up with so many double crosses and under the table deals as I did in this movie. Everyone had a hidden motive it seemed even Will Turner who in the last movie was just a trusting dupe. I can not believe no one seems to have the problems with this story as they did with Spidey 3 which I found very easy to follow. Add to that the fact that Captain Jack Sparrow, the sole character who made this series is not in it much and you have the disappointment of part two all over again. Granted it was not a huge disappointment, it was a good movie and it was great seeing Geoffrey Rusch back as Barbossa so it did get points for that. The story, this is going to be the hard part, however, I am keeping it as simple as possible. The gang is going in search for Jack, all with differing reasons. Jack is banished to Davey Jones locker and is going a bit crazy. There is a rescue and now there is a pirate meeting to attend, something about a song, a vengeful sea spirit named Calypso and various other obstacles leading to what I have to say is one heck of an action packed conclusion that is packed with great special effects. So there you have it, sure it could use a trimming of the run time as it goes on a while, but it still manages to entertain. I would have liked to see a simpler story though with a bit more comedy as there are some chuckle scenes, just nothing all that super funny like in the first. It was also surprising to see the villain from the last movie Davey Jones play basically a very small role till the very end during the uber action scene. Characters seemingly not all that important in the last film are now somewhat the focal point and you see Keith Richards in a small role as well. So as you can see there is a bit much going on and if there were a sequel to be made I say no Will or Elizabeth, bring back Barbossa, and have Jack Sparrow in it more and keep the plot more lighthearted and simple."
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),Plain bad,"POTC1 was one of the best movies I've ever seen. POTC2 was pretty good, though with some reservations. POTC3 is by far one of the worst. I wish I hadn't watched it. I feel like ripped off -- not only did I lose three hours of my life for this crap, but it also successfully killed all of the enjoyment I had for the first movie.

As it's already been said here by other reviewers, I attribute all its crappiness to the writers/producers team. The plot is as stupid and pointless and plot less as it gets. They killed all the lightweight enjoyable humor and spirit and feel of POTC1. They completely lost touch with reality. They even managed to spoil the Jack Sparrow character, first by not showing enough of him, and second by giving him such horrible lines and actions and behavior that made me wish they'd better not showed him at all. They... basically, everything that could be done wrong they did even worse than that.

To be fair, there are some good things about the movie. Sometimes good features can save an otherwise not-so-great movie; alas, that's not the case here -- on the contrary, it just makes me feel sorry for the effort wasted on this crap. E.g., although I have a problem with the whole resurrecting Barbossa idea, I enjoyed very much Geoffrey Rush's work in POTC3, he's just a brilliant actor and did a brilliant work, best in this movie.

I don't know what exactly they were thinking after the well-deserved success of the first movie, but turning into a trilogy (G-d forbid they decide to go on!) was a great marketing idea whose sole purpose obviously was to rip the world public for lots of money. This has nothing to do with movie-making. Can we sue them??"

And are they REALLY going to not like it? Nope. Just like how hardcore Star Wars fans forced themselves the like the prequel trilogy on principle alone, same applies here. Of course it's boring, long-winded, ridiculous and convoluted! The first one wasn't a ""good"" film by any stretch of the imagination, but it was entertainment and well heck, there really aren't any other pirate films to compare it to. After making a bazillion dollars, they decided a trilogy was somehow needed and they have the actor who could sell used condoms in it, so why not? Again, it doesn't matter in the the slightest, this is a cash cow that Disney is going to milk drier than the southwestern United States! DUH! YO HO, YO HO, A HARDCORE SUCKER IS YOU!

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),Somebody Give These Guys An Oscar,"A great film trilogy is a rare thing. Most trilogies have one film that is way below par (Indiana Jones for example). Others begin sucking after the first (Smokey & The Bandit). Very few trilogies keep the same quality throughout, although it has happened occasionally (Star Wars; Lord of The Rings). Perhaps the rarest of all is when the third film of a trilogy surpasses the previous two. In fact, it has only happened twice in the history of film. The first time was The Good, the Bad, & the Ugly in 1966. Forty-one years later, it happened again. This is the 2nd time.

Not only is this the best film of the year, it's the best Disney film ever. In addition, it is the greatest film in the (WARNING: I DO NOT WISH TO OFFEND ANYBODY SO IF YOU ARE A STAR WARS FAN STOP READING THIS NOW) greatest film trilogy of all time.

Perhaps the most special thing about this film is the fact that it manages to be both the darkest and the funniest film of the series. The opening scene was so grim that I thought I had gone into the wrong movie. The opening is the last thing you would expect from Disney (for that matter, so is the closing, but I won't ruin that for you). However, it is also the hardest I've laughed during a movie since Borat.

I won't give away any of the plot, but I will praise some of the performances. Johnny Depp (the greatest actor of his generation) is great as always. Orlando Bloom has came a long way since the first film and he gives a terrific performance. Keira is as hot as always and this is also her best performance to date. It was a real joy to see Geoffrey Rush back in the series. Chow Yun-Fat was great as the villain and Keith Richards' cameo was one of the funniest moments in the film.

One of the biggest criticisms I've heard is that the film is hard to follow. I don't understand this. It took me two viewings to figure out Dead Man's Chest, but I found this one very easy to follow.

I'll close by making one final point. This film deserves every Oscar available, with Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush sharing the honor for Best Supporting Actor.

Will it win any Oscars? Maybe a few technical awards and possibly Best Score. However, the major awards are all going to go to smaller films that nobody will see until after they win.

And why is this? Well, to paraphrase Stephen King, ""The critic's definition of over-rated is: something that too many people have enjoyed"".

Enjoy the film."

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),"Oy, Me Hearty - Check the flick or walk the plank, Yo Ho Ho!",spoiler warning
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),Don't Waste Your Money,"I hated this movie. The story line was impossible to follow. I had no idea who was fighting who for what almost the entire time. The only time I perked up was when Keith Richards made his much anticipated appearance as Jack Sparrow's father. Even that was a disappointment as his role was minimal and lines few.

Keira Knightly's costumes were absurd. Where on earth would she have picked up those outfits and managed as many changes as she did in the mêlée? Not to mention the stupid hat she wore throughout most of the movie.

I loved the first movie in the Trilogy, but I have to say that the second and third were progressively more disappointing than the last. Let's hope we have seen the end of the story before they ruin the memory of the first entirely.

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),"Entertaining, But Too Long","The good and bad of this third - and perhaps last - of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean' story:

It's not easy to keep people entertained these days for almost three straight hours, and the film-makers accomplished two-thirds of that. I might have ranked this higher, but it's too long at 169 minutes (almost three hours) .....way too long. Two hours would have been more than enough for this fantasy-adventure film. After that, I found myself getting bored with too much action and much of the same things I had already seen for two hours.

What I really appreciated in this movie was all the humor. I expected decent special-effects and diverse characters. There are a number of good laughs in here and they are provided by a variety of people, not just Johnny Depp as ""Capt. Jack Sparrow."" Even the parrot gets several laughs in here.

Since the entire cast was still intact, I was more interested in seeing some new faces and I really enjoyed Chow Yun-Fat whose major contributions came in the beginning of the film. Why he basically left after the opening part, I don't know, and the movie suffered for it. Mostly the film features a bunch of familiar people, none of whom we can predict what they'll do next. One minute they are good guys; the next minute, the bad guys. Unfortunately, that makes the story confusing in parts. So - if you got lost a few times, don't feel bad. It's understandable.

The only character who rubbed me the wrong way was the too politically-correct and almost insulting role of ""Elizabeth Swann,"" played by Keira Knightley. Why do filmmakers insist on giving us the pretty girls-who-beat up-all-the-men roles? It's so stupid. Overnight she becomes a super-skilled swordsman? Please, movie makers: stop giving us Rambo with makeup and cleavage! Let women be women and men be men!

Also, I wanted a high seas pirate adventure story, not some voodoo theology mumbo-jumbo, which took up too much of this story. What was this: Pirates of the Caribbean or Harry Potter? At times, it resembled more of the latter.

Geoffrey Rush as ""Captain Barbossa"" was the most interesting person in the film, in my opinion. He was terrific in every scene. Depp is always good, but I missed hearing him say, ""Savvy?"" He didn't say it once!

Overall, fun but overdone. Savvy?"
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),Terrible,"Well, after seeing Pirates II, I didn't think it was possible for III to be any worse.... I was wrong. This is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen. I understand that some movies are made just for ridiculous, but fun, action sequences and little or no plot line, and you can definitely tell which movies those are, but this one tried to have a decent plot, and failed miserably. Yes, the action sequences were fantastic and full of some of the most ridiculous stunts imaginable, but they in no way saved the horrible attempt at a plot line. With hardly any character development, far less Jack Sparrow than there should have been, the abandonment of the love triangle, the overly-dramatic attempt for an epic, and the complete lack of trying to be at least somewhat historically correct, the writers have caused cinema to reach a new low.

The first problem with the movie is that Jack Sparrow isn't seen for half an hour. Johnny Depp is pretty much what has made the Pirates films. And when you do finally get to see him, he has been downgraded to the status of comic relief, rather than the humorous hero he has played in the past. It is because of this that you actually start to wish that you see less of him. The corny, one-line jokes that just seem to perpetually flow forth from his mouth get old very, very quickly.

The second problem is, of course, the total lack of true interaction between the characters. Most of their speech is devoted to furthering the already failing plot, and the little that is actual development of their relationships is poorly written. Though I hated the idea of the love triangle between Will, Elizabeth, and Jack introduced in Pirates II, I was sad to see them completely abandon that idea, acting almost as though it had never happened.

The main problem that I had with the plot for this film is that it never really settled down. It was either moving forward far too fast for most of the audience to keep up with, or so dead still that half the audience was falling asleep (though the latter was far rarer). Plus the introduction of so many different plot devices and magic just made the story seem so implausible. I mean, I am a firm believer in the willing suspension of disbelief in small doses (such as the amount of disbelief I had to suspend in the first film), but if I was going to actually enjoy this movie, I would have had to have suspended it for almost the entire length of the film, and that's hard to do for near three hours.

And finally, the first film, as far as I know, was pretty much on par in terms of historical accuracy and pirate mythology. That is, it was very true to the era it was based in, and didn't have to add in all sorts of fantastical, magical things to give the film a sense of adventure. The only magic involved was the curse of the medallions. Which, while it may have dominated most of the plot, was rooted in some history and was presented in a plausible way. For that, I can suspend my disbelief. But when they start giving physical manifestations to Davy Jones (granted that was introduced in the second film, but still) and start calling Greek sea-nymphs (Calypso) Pirate goddesses; I'm sorry but I just can't do that. Not to mention them trying to claim that the pirates, as treacherous and murderous as they were, were actually all united under one flag is just ridiculous. No historical value (and very weak story value) whatsoever.

All in all, this film surpassed how terrible I expected it to be so horribly that I am honestly considering walking back to the theater and asking for compensation for the three wasted hours of my life."
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),Convoluted? Are you kidding???!!!,"I almost did not see this movie because of a number of reviews that reported the storyline as convoluted. Convoluted, are you kidding?? This movie was intricate with an ending, I believe, few could have figured out. The effects were excellent, with some magically memorable scenes. But anyone but a child or someone who does not want to think while viewing this movie, would find it convoluted or meandering. Are there holes, sure, but I know of very few movies without them. Although it has what could be considered multiple endings, these are character resolutions that help to complete this installment. Make sure that when you see this movie, that you sit through the end titles, because, as usual, there is a surprise at the end. Who knows, there may yet be another installment, but I doubt it.

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),Don't be surprised if you get terribly bored by this movie,"This is yet another Jerry Bruckheimer totally over-produced movie, very much like Pearl Harbor. It's useless crap leading nowhere. Boring, shallow, too long, too big, too many explosions, too many special effects, too much so-called ""action"" (which becomes nauseating quickly), too much noise, too many lame jokes, too much make-up but too many shiny white teeth, too much of everything except entertainment and engaging story. Best enjoyed if you're brain-dead, really. Very dull and a total waste of time. Thank goodness I did not see it in cinema but only on free TV. Money well saved. For me easily one of the most uninspired movies of all times. For an entertaining pirates movie see the lovely Geena Davis in Cutthroat Island. It's rated lower here on IMDb than POTC3, but at least it has charm and doesn't take itself too seriously.

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),"Fantastic film, If Johnny Depp is not your only reason for watching","At World's End is the third and final installment of the trilogy. The film picks up almost immediately after the second part.

The acting is great by everyone. However I was slightly disappointed by Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow. Jack got on my nerves at times and that is never a good sign.

The best performances were set by Geoffrey Rush and Keira Knightley. Barbossa and Elizabeth are the characters who've got the most wit in this film and you never know what they're gonna do next. Tom Hollander and Bill Nighy portray the villains Lord Cutler Beckett and Davy Jones and do that with style.

Overall this film is fantastic. Visual effect, Costume design and Music are all top-notch.

You'll really enjoy this film if Johnny Depp is not your only reason for watching the film."

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),"Simply a brilliant, action-packed, swashbuckling masterpiece!","I have become a massive fan of 'Pirates Of The Caribbean' lately. I was only about 9 or 10 when the 'Curse Of The Black Pearl' was released,so that is why it is my least favourite, which is strange because everyone thinks the first one is the best. I saw 'Dead Mans Chest' in the cinema 3 times because I thought it was totally awesome. Then, just 1 year later, the 3rd Pirates movie is made, and this is what I thought of that; I was HUGELY excited about seeing this film. I saw it on May 25th 2007. But I have to admit, when I first saw 'At Worlds End', I didn't exactly like it that much. It was only when I re-watched it on DVD today when I realised how amazing it really is. Captain Jack Sparrow is back and it seems he is here to stay, as this movie contains a HUGE battle at the end. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are back, which it a great exception. It was great to see Barbossa is no longer evil but is now on the good side. I am loving Davey Jones, just like I did in the previous movie. Bill Nighy is perfect for the role!!! The evil Lord Cutler Beckett had a much bigger role in this, which was great, as he is plays SOOOOO well. The new characters, like Captain Sao Feng were well done, too.

This movie really sucks you into it. The action is completely awesome and the humour, the fighting and everything else makes this movie a definete must-see!!!!"

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),Enjoyable and fun movie...,"Having been a big fan of COTBP I was wondering how they could better it our at least make a film half as good. DMC was enjoyable like its predecessor and had some great moments in it (the fighting on the wheel and the extremely funny scene where will and the crew are trying to swing to safety on the island) So when ATW came I was hoping for the same type of film. Good news is it is a good film and enjoyable for fans and newbies. If you can brave the run time and actually decide to have a good time you will enjoy this movie.

I won't spoil any part of the film because its the type of film you have to watch a few times to really appreciate how good it is, but overall it has good action scenes, and when the pace is slow it manages to keep you in the mood with some witty and funny moments.

So all in all don't read negative comments and automatically think to yourself that you don't want to watch the movie, It is enjoyable and comes highly recommended. So give in and go watch the first blockbuster of the year! 10/10"
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),fantastic movie,"Just saw the movie yesterday, a complete package of adventure, entertainment, comedy and action I loved the way it ended,wish the teaser leads us to a fourth part. But one can only hope. Jack sparrow was witty as ever ,Barbossa was great.i felt Elizabeth got a little too much of a role but she performed it with utter ease.thank goodness they did not kill William.I liked Pintel & Ragetti .There was excellent comic timing between them.This movie is definitely going to be the highest grosser in Hollywood this year.Overall a fantastic way to satisfy the pirates fans.

A must watch

There are some things you won't like, for the most of you a few things, for a few of you most things. But this is not a movie you'll love for its plot. You're going to love for its special effects better and better from the first chapter of the trilogy (the final battle is a masterpiece!), and because in this movie there's fun, a lot of fun: jack/johnny is irresistible, Barbossa is a great pirate and all the crew (pintel and ragetti over every other one) is hilarious. I saw it yesterday, but I'm going to see it again and again. Why? Because when you're on your seat and the light come down, then begins a show you cannot dislike. A suggestion? Enjoy it!

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),Emotional Puzzle,"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007, Dir. Gore Verbinski)

After losing Jack Sparrow to the locker of Davy Jones, the team of Will Turner, Elizabeth Swan and Captain Barbossa make their final alliances with the pirate world to take on the forces of Lord Cutler Beckett and his crew, including Davy Jones, who he now has control over. It's not going to be easy, as they must rescue Sparrow, convince all the pirate lords to join them and defeats Beckett, whilst each individual pirate has their own route which they wish to follow.

It's often a sad time for me, when i see a trilogy come to an end. There are so many great characters that you really do start to miss them. Unfortunately, trilogies always seem to have the problem are living up to the previous movies. 'At World's End' falls into this category. The characters are great as always with Geoffrey Rush bringing Barbossa back to life as much as he did in the first movie. The special effects are amazing again, with some beautiful crafted fight sequences and Davy Jones looking even more realistic. The music is fun again but disappointing compared to the first two films. The main problem with this film is the story. It's not the most easy to follow story and can really make you think for a bit. Still, the third 'Pirates' movie is a roller-coaster of a movie.

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),Pirates 3.,"I had been excited about this for MONTHS. i saw it on opening night and then another 3 times withing a week.

This one is just as good as the other two. The visual effects were grand. The fights were spectacular. I applaud everyone involved with this movie. Let's face it, trilogy's aren't easy to make, but Gore Verbinski made it look as easy as walking. All the time and work everyone put it into it paid off.

Captain Jack Sparrow was just as funny, Will was just as unpredictable, Elizabeth got Darker and Barbosa got nicer. The Keith Richards cameo was fabulous.

A lot of ends were tied up, but a lot were opened. I do hope to see a fourth and possibly a fifth.

I NEED MORE.

This movie deserves a 10."
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),Finale? Maybe not...,"Curse of the Black Pearl was a great movie unto itself and can easily stand alone without any problem. Dead Man's Chest, on the other hand, was a mild disappointment. It had many flaws and left you wondering what you just watched.

At World's End is a great movie all-around. From the heart-wrenching opening scene, to the heart-pounding, edge-of-your-seat sea battle, and of course the final scene before the credits (and don't forget the scene after the credits are over), AWE takes what was great of the first movie and takes it even further.

The action is awesome in this film. Cannons, muskets, and the clang of swords are everywhere, but it doesn't go overboard, nor does it seem out of place (like that wheel-balancing sword-fight in Dead Man's Chest). It just seems right.

But then there's the humor, that was ever-present in the Black Pearl, but seriously lacking in Dead Man's Chest. It's back, and boy is it great. Black Pearl became known for doing a great job at intertwining action and comedy, and At World's End brings it back and does a great job. Again, the comedy is no where out of place, and the timing is perfect.

Those in the press who gave this movie a disappointing rating need to see it again, and actually pay attention. Those who go into this movie with the predisposition that it'll be disappointing will only find disappointment, and thus will miss the great experience that At World's End is. The storyline is beautifully done and leaves you wanting more.

And to those who call this a finale, not so fast. There is plenty left open, plenty of questions to be answered, and the ending scene following the credits, along with the last scene before the credits is proof of this. Will they make a fourth Pirates? Who knows, but I'm hoping so, and that fourth Pirates would easily make a finale.

With the resurrection of the comedy and action found in Curse of the Black Pearl and the elimination of many of the problems with Dead Man's Chest, At World's End is a great film that is going to be on my buy list when it hits store shelves (Blu-Ray, of course). I highly recommend this film for those who loved the first movie and either loved or even felt disappointed by the second.

I give this film, its actors, actresses and crew, a 10 out of 10. Anything less would be piracy."
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),You can put lipstick on a pig but its still a pig,"You know those wax deserts that they bring out at restaurants like Johnny Carino's and Red Lobster. They look really good, but try taking a bite out of it and all you get is a mouth full of wax. That's how Pirates of the Caribbean at World's End made me feel. It has amazing visuals. Duh. Every special effects movie made from here to the end of eternity is going to have amazing visuals. If you haven't noticed by now nerds with computers can do some really cool stuff if you throw enough money at them. Back in the 90's good visuals could carry a movie, like say, Independence Day, but they can't do it any more. In the past 10 years we've seen people fly and dodge bullets in slow motion, we've seen New York City destroyed in a disturbingly large variety of ways, we've seen the armies of Rohan ride to the rescue of Gondor crushing orcs under foot, we've seen every imaginable object or animal anthropomorphized from toys, to cars, to penguins several times over. All that to say you can't just impress me with visuals anymore. I demand a story I can follow and enjoy; is that too much to ask of a good movie? I'm not asking for Dickens, not even Tom Clancy, just a passable story that an intelligent person can follow. Pirates doesn't give me this. And more than that, it takes lovable characters and diminishes them by placing them into this joke of a script. You know why the first Pirates movie was good? I didn't know a person who sat down to watch it who didn't like it. Now 90% of the audience is walking out of the theaters scratching their heads."
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),Not bad,spoiler warning
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),Best blockbuster movie since '300',"This summer is the season for threequels. Already we have seen ""Spider-Man 3"" and ""Shrek the Third"" hit the theaters and do quite well. Now it time for a new one in ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End."" Does this movie have a chance at succeeding at the box office? Will it be a success or a failure? Read this review and find out for yourself.

""At World's End"" takes place shortly after the events of ""Dead Man's Chest."" The crew members of the Black Pearl, with the help of Captain Barbossa and Tia Dalma, must set out to ""Davy Jones' Locker"" in order to save Jack Sparrow. In the mean time, Lord Cutler Beckett and the East India Trading Company has teamed up with Davy Jones to destroy every man, woman and child that has ever had anything to do with piracy. Now these pirates are forced to unite in order to keep living the way they do.

If you are a fan of the first two, you will dig this movie. All of the great elements on the series are still here. The action scenes and special effects were even better this time around. The fantasy elements are still present. Jack Sparrow steals the show with every scene he is in, which is a big sign that his antics have not gone tiresome. Han Zimmer has another brilliant film score. This all means that if you liked the others, you will enjoy this.

The acting was acceptable. Of course, Johnny Depp can play Jack Sparrow in his sleep. It was very nice to see Geoffrey Rush back in action as Caption Barbossa. Keira Knightley has improved a lot since the first film as Elizabeth Swann. Bill Nighy is wonderful as Davy Jones, even with all the CG. Newcomers Chow Yun-Fat (Captain Sao Feng) and Keith Richards (Jack Sparrow's father, Captain Teague) gave great contributions to the movie.

A note to parents: this movie is the darkest and most adult of the series. There are a few scenes, biggest one in the first scene, which seemed strangely placed in a Disney flick. There are also some sexual innuendos in there as well. It definitely deserves the PG-13 rating. This film did not feel like a Disney movie, but then again, none of them do anyway. Nonetheless, if your kids can handle it take them because it is a great family flick.

Overall, if you a fan of the first two, you will love these. This is just as enjoyable as the first two. This is one of the must-see movies on the big screen. If you did not like the other two, do not see it because you will not like it. One small plot hole was brought to this reviewer's attention after the movie ended but it is neither big nor noticeable so it is not a big deal. At the end of the movie, there was a lot of applause from the audience and it truly deserved it. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" is extremely recommended!

Don't forget to stay for the credits."

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),The only piracy was committed by the producers,"I'm writing this review for two reasons: first, to serve as a warning; and second, as a form of therapy for what was a shockingly horrific experience. If you enjoy movies in any way, avoid this one. Here be monsters.

I really enjoyed 'Dead Man's Chest', which, to say it was based on a theme park ride, had a real swashbuckling feel to it. The second movie was disappointing, but 'World's End' was insulting. One character mentions that ""its only business"" and you get the distinct feeling that it was an often repeated line by those making the movie. The only form of piracy was the fact that people had to pay to see this movie.

To criticise the plot seems a little pointless because there really isn't one. The movie stumbles like a senile blind-man from one character to another as we are supposed to be convinced that everyone is out for themselves, but they're all lovable rogues really. You soon come to hate each character for wasting your time before the plot kicks in (which it doesn't). It truly proves that a mass of characters does not in itself make a movie.

The outstanding thing about this movie is how you are constantly surprised. After a scene that leaves you feeling that that must be the lowest point, another pops up that's even worse. When one of the characters attempts a rousing speech the collective sigh of the movie watchers was very impressive. The speech itself was as shrill as it was clichéd.

To all the movie-goers out there I say: avoid this movie or simple post in your money to the producers and save yourself a couple of hours. To the makers of this movie I recommend reading Capt. Charles Johnson's 'A general history of the robberies and murders of the most notorious pirates' either that or using a dictionary. P is for Pirate.

How can you make a pirate movie without any piracy?"
